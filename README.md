# Browser-Automation-Using-Selenium

Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program. It is functional for all browsers and works on all major OS. It's scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc. I have worked with Python.
Mastering Selenium will help you automate your day to day tasks like controlling your tweets, Whatsapp texting, and even just googling without actually opening a browser in just 15-30 lines of python code. The limits of automation are endless with selenium.
For installing Selenium, use the pip command in your command prompt as:
pip install Selenium
